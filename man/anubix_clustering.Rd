\title{Network clustering of the gene set and then ANUBIX is applied}
\usage{
anubix_clustering(network, links_matrix, genesets, pathways, cores = 2,
sampling = 2000)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{A data.frame. Two columns if the network has no weights. Where column 1 and column 2 are genes. Each row means a link between genes. If the network is weighted, then the third column are the weights of the links.}

\item{links_matrix}{A numeric matrix. Links_matrix stores the links each gene has to each pathway. The number of rows equals to the number of genes in the network and the number of columns equals to the number of pathways under study.}

\item{genesets}{A data.frame of two columns. Column 1, are the genes and column 2 the experiment where they belong to.}

\item{pathways}{A data.frame of two columns. Column 1 are the genes and second column the pathway where they belong to.}

\item{cores}{A numeric value. Cores is defined as the number of cores used by the algorithm. The default value is \strong{2}}

\item{sampling}{A numeric value. Sampling is defined as the number of random samplings required to construct the null distribution. The default value is \strong{2000}}
}
\value{
A list with two dataframes:
\itemize{
\item gene    -   Gene belonging to the module.
\item module   -   Module from the clustering approach.
}
\itemize{
\item geneset   -   Gene set under study.
\item pathway   -   Pathway under study.
\item obv_links -   Observed number of links between the gene set and the pathway.
\item exp_mean  -   Expected number of links between the gene set and the pathway.
\item overlap   -   Number of genes shared by the gene set and the pathway
\item p-value   -   p-value of the test.
\item q-value   -   Corrected p-value using Benjamini-Hochberg.
\item FWER      -   Corrected p-value using Bonferroni correction.
\item module    -   Module from the clustering approach.
}
}
\description{
Clusters the gene set using Infomap and then applies ANUBIX.

\note{
anubix_links() needs to be run beforehand
